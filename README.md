# <Expanding Your Online Business>

## Description

My motivation for completing this HTML is to give users that aren't to familiar with running a business online a little bit of pointers and insight on running and certain areas that can expand their online business.

This project was built as a guide to users that are inexperienced when it comes to certain factors that are important when it comes to setting up an online business from marketing all the way to cost management.

This project solved problems such as accessibility, marketing, and how to gain more traffic when it comes to doing an online business. It shows how to generate leads, cut marketing cost and tt is accessible to people with disabilities because of its alternative text in images it ranks high in search engines such as google to show customers how to generate leads
